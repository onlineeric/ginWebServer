# Eric's Go and Gin Framework Learning Project

Welcome! This repository is a personal project, where I, Eric Cheng, am learning and studying the Go programming language and the Gin web framework.

## Project Description

This project serves as a demonstration of my progress in learning Go and Gin. I use it to explore various features and concepts in Go programming and Gin web development.

## Goals

1. Understand the basic syntax and structure of Go programs.
2. Learn how to set up a web server using the Gin framework.
3. Explore Go's standard library and third-party Go libraries.

## Project Ambition

Beyond this Go and Gin implementation, my overarching objective is to create a multi-language demo project that showcases my knowledge and skills. I plan to replicate this project in .NET and Rust to demonstrate proficiency across these platforms. Furthermore, I intend to develop a corresponding user interface using ReactJS, thus highlighting my front-end development capabilities as well. 

## Installation and Running

To install the project, make sure you have Go installed, then clone the repository:

https://github.com/online.eric/ginWebServer.git

cd into ginWebServer, and run the project with:

`go run .`
